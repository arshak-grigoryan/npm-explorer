# npm Explorer

## Motivation

Create an npm package explorer app similar to https://www.npmjs.com/ with npm public API and extend search functionality with advanced sort options, package download statistics, light and dark mode, etc.

## Resources

- [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [REGISTRY-API](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md)
- [download-counts](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/download-counts.md)
- [logos](https://github.com/npm/logos)

## App

The app clones the npm website package search and views UI/UX with some additions.
